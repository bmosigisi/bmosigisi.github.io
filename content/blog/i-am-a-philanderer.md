I am a philanderer  
I am afraid of a real woman  
A real Maya Angelou type  
Whose love would destroy me  
The last time I had a real woman  
Her love destroyed me  
I've been healing since  
So I fill my nights  
With cheap dalliances  
And broken promises  
And swift silences  
To a real woman  
Who dares.
