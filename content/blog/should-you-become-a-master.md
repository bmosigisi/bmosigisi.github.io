>Choose something that you enjoy doing and do it with integrity, without expecting an outcome.

I'm not sure where I heard these words, but they stuck with me.

I was hesitant on writing this because I feel it reveals an integral part of me. A part I would rather keep hidden. Partly because it may point to a chink in the armour (which would taint the unreasonable and perfect reputation I've spent so many years cultivating) and partly, I suppose because I don't fully understand it. In a world where almost everyone is hiding behind a carefully curated persona, it's difficult to share certain things. Although sharing it allows me to face it head on, gather my thoughts and perhaps grow from them. I might even be lucky to inspire growth in someone going through something similar.

As far as I can remember, my life has always felt like an internal struggle between a bunch of personalities and interests.

In one moment I seriously consider dropping everything to pursue music and in the next I can't be bothered to pick up a musical instrument. At once I might decide that pouring my soul into software development is the pragmatic choice, and then coding starts feeling like a chore. At times I might be deeply moved by a masterful film and I start studying the art of film making, the next moment I can't be arsed to watch anything besides trash tv. Let alone read a film transcript. Sometimes I'm taken by a turn of phrase and I get into writing, but then I get bored and go weeks, months, without picking up a book, let alone a pen. Occasionally I might get an epiphany on how combining all my interests is the answer but the weightiness of it all leaves me overwhelmed. The big struggle though is the guy that likes to party and the one who wants to be a musician-coder-director-writer-chef-pool-player. More hyphens to come. Unfortunately I have been ill-equipped to handle it and only recently have I been able to obtain some semblance of a handle on it

I believe some of it stems from a childhood of being constantly told I'm the best. Whenever there's something I absolutely have to do, I have a tendency of leaving it undone until the very last moment. I don't recall ever studying for an exam more than a week out. Work tasks that are supposed to take a whole two-week sprint end up being crushed in the last two days. The higher the difficulty, the better. In fact, even as I write this, I'm supposed to be urgently implementing a RAG pipeline for a startup called [Recision](https://www.recision.ai/) that I'm building with friends. Even though I learnt the acronym about a week ago, I'm still here biding time (that's kind of a lie though, because I'm a lot better at this). The tragedy of the whole thing is, in most if not all of these occasions, I end up completing the said tasks, which further reinforces the narrative; I'm the flippin best. What this has done, so I've gathered in my amateur sleuthing, is created a deeply engrained belief that I'm Midas with gold in over abundance. This has in equal parts served me really well (the real life effects of grand self-delusion are well documented and studied, just look at Kanye) and been my downfall. I haven't been able to pick a lane and become a master of it, due to my very many interests. How are you meant to choose when you can do anything? Like, literally? Why should you?
On top of that, when you have [discerning taste](https://x.com/brianmosigisi/status/1941133408555749846) and interests in droves, your output feels inadequate in many cases. Especially in subjective things like art where you have to get past [the taste gap](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/01/29/ira-glass-success-daniel-sax/) in order to actually get good. You end up placing undue pressure of immediate excellence on yourself, perhaps more than the average guy.

The good news is, I'm turning this ship around.


Tools I've found useful:
- Embracing it. I have range. The certainty of age.
- Walt Whitman - I contain multitudes.
- The cult of done. Accepting that everything is a draft.
