A solitary human is an unremarkable creature with a fickle memory. Our brains aren't even the largest on earth. All human achievement can be attributed to the compounded gains of millennia of our combined knowledge. [Our collective ability to retain things as a species has trended downwards since we started delegating remembering to the convenient devices in our pockets](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/10/are-google-and-smartphones-degrading-our-memories/). Can you really drive home from work without using maps?

This stands in contrast to the promise of the information age, where all is accessible. The tragedy is, we can only reproduce a tiny fraction of the books, blog posts, social media posts and videos we ingest everyday, which renders this deluge purposeless. You might try to take notes but if they are strewn all over with no structure and unattainable by future you, then you might as well not keep them. [Building a second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) promises that it can help you "cultivate a body of knowledge that is uniquely your own", where you can find anything you've stored within seconds.
